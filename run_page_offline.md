2. **Install Jekyll and Bundler Gems**:
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

3. **Clone Your GitHub Pages Repository**:
   Replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` with your details:

## Steps to Run Your Site Offline

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your repository directory to install the required gems:
```bash
bundle install
```

### 2. Serve the Site Locally
To start a local server for your site, use the command:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### 3. Access the Local Site
After running the above command, Jekyll will provide a local address, typically:
```
http://127.0.0.1:4000
```
Open this URL in your browser to preview your site.

### 4. Monitor Changes in Real-Time
Jekyll automatically detects changes in your files and rebuilds the site. Simply refresh your browser to see the updates.

## Optional: Stop the Server
To stop the local server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Error: "Command not found: bundle"**
   - Ensure Ruby and Bundler are installed correctly. Run:
     ```bash
     gem install bundler
     ```

2. **Port Already in Use**:
   - If the default port (`4000`) is in use, specify a different port:
     ```bash
     bundle exec jekyll serve --port 5000
     ```

3. **Changes Not Showing**:
   - If changes arenâ€™t visible, clear your browser cache or restart the server.
