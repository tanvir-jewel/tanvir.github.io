          <p class="card-text"> <p>My research resides somewhere at the intersection of artificial life, evolutionary biology, and evolutionary computation. 
I am broadly interested in how evolutionary processes remain open-ended, continuously generating increasingly complex organisms. My work is a mishmash of using digital evolution to study
general properties of evolving systems and of drawing inspiration from natural evolution and its byproducts to develop new evolutionary computation techniques and representations. Below are some of my current research projects. If anything is of interest to you, feel free to <a href="#contact-me">contact me</a>!</p>

                <div class="card-text"> <p>Genetic programming (GP) is the application of natural principles to evolve
computer programs rather than by writing them by hand. 
The types of programs that are easily evolvable depends on the underlying
programming representation - <em>i.e.</em>, the way we organize and interpet programs.</p>

<p>SignalGP is a new GP technique designed to give evolution direct access to the
event-driven programming paradigm where computations are triggered response to 
signals from the environment, from other agents, or that are internally generated. 
I designed and developed the initial version of SignalGP in 2017, resulting 
in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3205455.3205523">paper</a> and a talk at GECCO 2018
where I demonstrate the value of giving evolution direct access to the event-driven
paradigm.</p>

<p>I am currently working on several extensions to the SignalGP representation,
such as function regulation, multi-representation SignalGP, and multi-level/hierarchical
SignalGP.</p>

an individual: formerly independent individuals unite to form a new, more
complex lifeform. Examples include the evolution of eukaryotes, multicellularity,
and eusocial insect colonies. From a computational perspective, major transitions
in individuality result in distributed systems.</p>

<p>The goal of this research is to develop a digital model for studying biological
evolutionary transitions, allowing us to ask general questions about their dynamics.
In the context of evolutionary computation, a system capable of transitions
in individuality would be useful for allowing evolution to incrementally build
distributed solutions.
I am currently working to extend the SignalGP represention to allow co-evolving
programs to unite to form hiearchically organized programs.</p>

MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven
valuable for exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational
problem. In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic
traits of prospective solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits
and maintains only the most fit organism found with those traits. The resulting map
of trait combinations allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each
trait relates to fitness and how traits interact.

</small></blockquote>

<p>If we define a MAP-Elites map with traits associated with different aspects
of our genetic programming representation (<em>e.g.</em>, functions, program length, <em>etc</em>.),
we can use MAP-Elites as a tool to explore how different aspects of different
representations interact across different problems. Are there trade-offs
between different aspects of our representation? Are there parts of representation-space
that are unlikely to yield solutions? Exploring our GP representations in this
way may inform how we configure things such as variation/mutation or selection operators.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">The evolution of phenotypic plasticity and gene regulation</h4>
                <div class="card-text"> <p>Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of a genotype to express different
phenotypes (<em>e.g.</em>, traits or characteristics) in response to different 
environmental conditions. Plasticity is often leveraged as a strategy to 
cope with heterogenous environments. In computer science, our computer programs
are often plastic in the sense that they may perform different computations
in response to different types of input.
The programmatic underpinning of many types of computational plasticity
are flow control statements (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code>).
In biological organisms, the genetic underpinning of many types of phenotpyic
plasticity is gene regulation.</p>

<p>The goal of this research is to study the step-by-step process by which gene
regulation and phenotypic plasticity evolve. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.7551/978-0-262-33936-0-ch063">this paper</a> for work using
Avida to observe the step-by-step process by which phenotypic plasticity evolves.
Currently, I am working on extending SignalGP to allow for more biologically
inspired forms of function regulation, making it a good model for studying the
process by which gene regulation and any resulting phenotypic plasticity evolves.</p>

                  <figcaption class="figure-caption ml-2 mr-2">This figure shows time slices of the ancestral lineages of dominant digital organisms from
100 independent replicates of evolution using the Avida Digital Evolution Platform.
Each lineage is represented as a vertical sequence of states over time where states
are defined by the phenotype of ancestral organisms on the lineage. State changes
imply a change in phenotype along the lineage.

In this particular condition, digital organisms must evolve a form of phenotypic 
plasticity: the ability to alter their phenotype depending on the current state
of the environment. In this case, the environment cycles between two possible
states at a regular interval.

Time (updates) flows from top to bottom of the figure. The environment is given
by the left-most vertical bar. Each lineage state sequence is represented
by a single vertical bar, and states along the sequence are denoted by color.
This type of visualization lets us see, at a glance, how lineages traversed
phenotype space in route to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.
