  My publications can also be found on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lPEOU2wAAAAJ&hl=en).
    
overview: |
  Because my work often spans multiple disciplines, I publish in a variety of 
  venues with different norms and conventions. 
  In addition to each publication's citation information, which will include links
  to a pdf version when possible, I have attached an assortment of informative icons
  (idea credit: [Emily Dolson](http://emilyldolson.com/)).
  The [iconography table](#iconography-table) gives each icon and their meaning.
  Icons to the left of a publication’s citation information specify the
  venue where the work was published.
  Icons below a publication’s citation information specify other information.
