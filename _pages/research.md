    "The security of our digital infrastructure depends not just on the software we write,
    but on the hardware foundation it runs upon. In an era of complex supply chains and
    sophisticated adversaries, we must secure silicon from the ground up."

overview: |
    My research focuses on **hardware security** and **microelectronics trust**, with particular emphasis on protecting commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) processors from malicious threats. I develop novel approaches using **side-channel analysis**, **electromagnetic monitoring**, and **secure coding techniques** to detect hardware Trojans and protect sensitive data on untrusted silicon. My work spans from theoretical foundations to practical implementations, aiming to create robust security solutions for embedded systems and critical infrastructure. Below are my current research projects. If you're interested in collaboration or have questions, feel free to [contact me](/contact/)!
