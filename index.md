  <strong style="color: red;">The website is currently under construction</strong>

  Welcome to my website! I’m Tanvir Hossain, a PhD researcher in Electrical Engineering at the University of Kansas. Here, I share my journey—from my early days at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST), where I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, to my current research and teaching experiences.

  **My Vision**  
  I aspire to transform this platform into a hub for hardware enthusiasts, providing curated resources on microelectronics, circuit design, and hardware security. Along with technical insights, I plan to include blog posts that explore philosophical perspectives—because I believe that engineering isn’t just about circuits and code; it’s also about curiosity, creativity, and the human experience.

  **Research & Interests**  
  - **Hardware Security**: My primary focus is on detecting and mitigating hardware Trojans to safeguard the integrity of microelectronic systems.  
  - **Cryptographic Hardware & Microprocessor Design**: I’m passionate about designing secure integrated circuits and exploring cutting-edge approaches to protect them from evolving threats.  
  - **Community & Accessibility**: I firmly believe knowledge should be accessible to all and aim to foster a supportive environment for continuous learning.

  **What to Expect**  
  - **Curated Learning Resources**: Tutorials, guides, and recommended readings related to microelectronics and hardware security.  
  - **Blog Posts**: Technical deep dives and philosophical musings—offering a holistic view of what it means to be a researcher, teacher, and lifelong learner.

  Thank you for joining me on this journey. If you have any questions or wish to collaborate, feel free to reach out. Let’s learn, explore, and innovate together!
