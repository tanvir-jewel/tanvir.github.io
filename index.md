about_me: |
  Welcome to my website! I'm Tanvir Hossain, a PhD researcher in Electrical Engineering at the University of Kansas. This is my portfolio website, where I document my research, academic journey, and teaching experiences - from my early days at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST) to my current work in microelectronics and hardware security.

  **My Vision**
  This platform serves as a dedicated space for my research activities in microelectronics, circuit design, and hardware security. I aim to share insights from my research and academic works, including research findings, project developments, and technical discussions. Occasionally, I will also explore philosophical perspectives and broader academic themes through blog posts.

  **Research & Interests**
  - **Hardware Security**: My research focuses on detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ICs. I develop techniques using formal verification and side-channel analysis to enhance the security of microelectronic systems.
  - **Secure Hardware Design**: I work on designing robust and attack-resilient integrated circuits, employing cutting-edge cryptographic and architectural strategies to defend against evolving threats.
  - **Engineering Education**: I am committed to making knowledge accessible. I design gamified learning modules to simplify computer hardware concepts for high school and early undergraduate students, fostering a more interactive and engaging learning experience.

  **What to Expect**
  - **Curated Learning Resources**: Tutorials, guides, and recommended readings related to microelectronics and hardware security.
  - **Blog Posts**: Technical deep dives and philosophical musings - offering a holistic view of what it means to be a researcher, teacher, and lifelong learner.

  Thank you for visiting! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or are interested in collaborating.
