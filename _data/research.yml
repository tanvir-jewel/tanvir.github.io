- project: Side-Channel Assisted Runtime Integrity Monitoring
  description: |
    **Detecting hardware Trojans in real-time without golden references**

    Commercial processors in critical systems face threats from supply-chain attacks and hardware Trojans. Traditional detection methods require pristine "golden" reference chips that are often unavailable. I develop **contactless electromagnetic (EM) side-channel monitoring** techniques that can fingerprint legitimate control-flow behavior and detect malicious activity in real-time.

    My approach uses **spectral analysis** combined with **watermarking techniques** to precisely locate attacked code blocks in multi-core COTS processors. This method provides runtime assurance without requiring invasive modifications or golden references, making it practical for deployment in real-world systems.

    *Key innovations: Non-invasive EM monitoring, real-time Trojan detection, watermark-based localization*

- project: Run-time Protection of Secrets in COTS Processors

    **Keeping sensitive data encoded during execution on untrusted silicon**

    Modern processors leak sensitive information through side-channels and hardware Trojans. I design **software frameworks** that employ **Residue Number Coding** to keep sensitive data encoded throughout the entire execution pipeline, ensuring that raw secrets never appear in the microarchitecture.

    The **HOACS (Homomorphic Obfuscation Assisted Concealing of Secrets)** system demonstrates how to protect against both hardware Trojans and side-channel attacks with minimal performance overhead. This approach is particularly suitable for embedded COTS processors where security cannot be compromised.

    *Key innovations: Residue number system encoding, minimal overhead protection, COTS processor compatibility*

- project: Side-Channel Assisted Verification for COTS
  description: |
    **Detecting sequential hardware Trojans through finite state machine analysis**

    Sequential hardware Trojans that activate after specific trigger sequences pose unique detection challenges. I develop novel approaches that analyze **finite state machines** through integrated **power and EM side-channel data** to detect these sophisticated threats.

    This verification approach enables detection of complex Trojans in COTS processors without requiring proprietary design information, making it practical for security evaluation of commercial hardware in critical applications.

    *Key innovations: FSM-based analysis, integrated power/EM monitoring, sequential Trojan detection*

- project: Gamified Learning Framework for Computer Hardware Fundamentals
  description: |
    **Making hardware security education engaging and accessible**

    Building the next generation of hardware security experts requires innovative educational approaches. Through **NSF-funded research**, I develop **hardware-based games** that teach fundamental computer hardware concepts using **Verilog**, **FPGAs**, and **ESP32 development boards**.

    This gamified framework makes complex topics like side-channel analysis, hardware Trojans, and secure design accessible to high school students and early undergraduates. Students learn by doing, building real circuits and observing security vulnerabilities firsthand.

    Summer camp evaluations show significant improvements in **systems thinking** and **retention rates**, demonstrating the effectiveness of hands-on, game-based learning for technical subjects.
